# WeatherApp

WeatherApp is a weather application built in SwiftUI, utilizing `SwiftData` for data management and `WidgetKit` to display a dynamic widget on the home screen. The app allows users to search for cities, save favorite locations, and display current and forecasted weather conditions.

## Features

- **Weather Search:** Users can search for weather in selected cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Favorites List:** Users can add cities to their favorites for quick access to current weather information.
- **Dynamic Widget:** The home screen widget displays the current temperature, weather icon, and city name. Clicking on the widget takes the user to the detailed weather view in the app.

## Project Structure

### Main Components

- **`ContentView.swift`**: The main view structure of the app, responsible for searching cities and displaying the list of favorites.
- **`LocationWeatherView.swift`**: A detailed view showing the full weather forecast for the selected city.
- **`API.swift`**: A class responsible for fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **`CurrentResponse.swift` & `ForecastData.swift`**: Data models for mapping JSON responses from the API to Swift structures.
- **`Wigets files`**: Code responsible for creating the widget, integrating with WidgetKit, and managing widget data.

### Widget

- **`WeatherWidgetMedium`**: Medium-sized widget with detailed weather information. Displays the city name, temperature, feels like temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloudiness, visibility, and pressure.

- **`WeatherWidget`**: Small widget with basic weather information. Shows the city name, current temperature, and weather icon.

- **`WeatherWidgetForecast`**: Medium-sized widget with a forecast for the next few hours. Presents the city name along with forecasted temperatures and icons for the upcoming hours.
